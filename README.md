# Thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Linda (she/her), a friendly and analytical web developer building with design, data, and details in mind!

**I'm available to hire!**
I'm looking for my first front end developer position! I'm looking for a company that values open communication between co-workers and management, room to grow and learn, and is working on a product that will benefit others.

Here's my resume if you're interested!

## Currently Working On

I'm trying to decide what my next project will be! I've been learning GraphQL, will be doing a Rust speed run soon (I think!), and always want to improve my JS skills - I'm getting decent with Vue, but would like to use React soon too. I have a few ideas, just thinking through what I want to focus on next!
