## Hello ðŸ‘‹!

Iâ€™m a front-end software engineer with an artistic background. Iâ€™m also a career changer with top-tier communication and organization skills. I build friendly, accessible designs and modern, maintainable JavaScript logic. My mix of creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and grit helps me craft sites that are a joy to use.

## Portfolio

I highly recommend that you check out my personal site, **[lindakat.com](https://www.lindakat.com)**!
<br>
You'll find demos of projects I've worked on, all my technical writings, and a bit more about me there. It's my personal playground and where I show off all the cool things I work on! (And if you'd like to see the source code, the repo is pinned below!)

## Uses

At home I'm a Windows user. I have a Lenovo Legion Slim 7 laptop to use as my main coding machine! I also use VSCode as my editor of choice (currently loving the Witch Hazel Hypercolor theme). But remember - do and use what works best for you! There is no "perfect" tool - just the one that allows you to do what you're trying to do best.

### You are headed down your path at your own pace, and with every obstacle you are trying your utmost best. Be patient with yourself, and remember that big things are achieved not all at once, but one day at a time.
