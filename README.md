## Thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Linda! Iâ€™m a career changer who builds stuff for the web and brings teams together. My background in customer service and the arts has given me resilience, communication skills, and empathy. I love logic puzzles and visual design, and bringing the two together to build experiences that make life easier for everyday people is my passion.

## Portfolio

I highly recommend that you check out my personal site, **[lindakat.com](https://www.lindakat.com)**!
<br>
You'll find demos of projects I've worked on, all my technical writings, and a bit more about me there. It's my personal playground and where I show off all the cool things I work on!

## Uses

At home I'm a Windows user. I just got a new Lenovo Legion laptop to use as my main coding machine! I also use VSCode as my editor of choice. But remember - do and use what works best for you! There is no "perfect" tool - just the one that allows you to do what you're trying to do best.
